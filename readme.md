Because I find typing everything out for creating a grid in tkinter,
I tought of finding a way to create my interface in Photoshop, 
then slice it as if I would export it to an html file table,
then use the html and sliced images createed by Photoshop's 
Save for Web feature to create a TK Windw with the grid.
